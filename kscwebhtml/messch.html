Assalamu-alaikum to everybody. Welcome to the website of Knowledge School &amp; College. I feel greatly honoured that I’m going to write a few words as Chairman of the Governing Body of this institution. In spite of my huge professional involvement, I never miss any opportunity to contribute to the development of this institution. The best thing about Knowledge is that, It is the dream child of some like-minded learned civil and military officers who are eager to contribute positively in society. As a result, every member of this family has become an integral part of a larger whole and they contribute to the best of their abilities. Vision or mission whatever you say, our aim is to help each student grow as good human being with a bright future ahead. It sounds simple but it demands commitment and dedication, what we strongly believe, we have. <br> <br>

Knowledge School &amp; College is making its way slowly but steadily and its success will be distinctly clear in no time – In Sha Allah. I wish every success of this institution. <br> <br> <br>
